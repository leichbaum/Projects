This project was a about a ficticious school called the College of Arts and Sciences that needed to upgrade their course curriculum. They had problems with stagnant enrollment, and lacked concentration areas for their electives. Through data mining in KNIME and using several clustering algorithms, I was able to provide a detailed analysis on what electives should be concentrated together. This report includes information on K-medoids clustering, the DBSCAN algorithm, hierarchical clustering, another more techniques and data wrangling used to be successful in this assignment.
